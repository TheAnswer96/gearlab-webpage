                <h3>BREADCRUMBS</h3>
                <h4>Building up Robust and Efficient routing Algorithms for Drones by integrating Connectivity and Risk awareness in an Urban air Mobility Bvlos Scenario</h4>
                <p><b>2024 – ??</b></p>
                <p>
                    In this project, we propose to plan BVLoS UAVs flights by focusing on a few key missions as follows: i) suburban missions:
                    UAVs are used for collecting images/data or for performing aerial work such as spraying on agriculture or monitoring corridors
                    like rivers, electricity, and gas pipelines; and ii) urban missions: UAVs are used for structural health monitoring of buildings,
                    traffic monitoring, food/beverage, small parcel mail, or biomedical goods delivery. In suburban missions, we will i) analyze the
                    link quality and constraints offered by the cellular networks; ii) analyze the risk of UAVs; and iii) propose routing algorithms
                    that consider both connectivity and risk assessment processes. In urban missions, we will i) optimize the Quality of Service
                    (QoS) of the communications; ii) evaluate the security and safety robustness; and iii) devise advanced UAV routing and
                    scheduling algorithms extended also to multiple UAVs.

                    The aims of the project are: (a) the design and implementation of an autonomous innovative data
                    acquisition system in-field to detect HH and other pests as well, (b) the design and implement a
                    classification system to detect fruits damages not visible at naked eye, (c) a software solution,
                    based on ML techniques, to derive as furthest as we can the epidemiological model of HH or/and other
                    pests, and (d) a logbook available to further steps of the fruit production chain.

                <p><b>May 2016 – April 2020</b></p>
                <p>
                    The GEO-SAFE project, aims at creating a network enabling the two regions to exchange knowledge,
                    ideas and experience, thus boosting the progress of wildfires knowledge and the related development
                    of innovative methods for dealing efficiently with such fires. More precisely, the GEO-SAFE project
                    focuses on developing the tools enabling to set up an integrated decision support system optimizing
                    the resources during the response phase.
